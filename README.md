**Goal:** Revision and refinements of the reflection tool 
**Time:** 45 mins
**Task:** Revision of the prior information and visualisations.

### Instructions:

This is your space to configure the reflection tool of your dreams!

 -  Place [drag and drop] any visualisation or element you want to have in your reflection tool. Place as many you want!
 -  If there is any other visualisation or element that is not listed here, use the **idea card** to add your own visualisation or element.
 -  If you want to add details to any visualisation or element, grab an explanation card or add your own explanation.

**Every time you add a visualisation or element, tell us:**

 -  Why you choose that visualisation or element
 -  How is going to help you during the reflection
 -  Is there any additional information needed.

**Guiding questions about the visualisations:**

 - How can **improve** the bar chart categories? 
 - How can we **improve** the team positioning and communication visualisation? What types of **explanations** would you like to have on these visualisations?
