# Design workshops


## Eliciting user's needs through a collaborative board

**Goal:** Refinements of the visualisation and eliciting needs for the reflection tool 

### Instructions:
This is your space to configure the reflection tool of your dreams!
 -  Place [drag and drop] any visualisation or element you want to have in your reflection tool. Place as many you want!
 -  If there is any other visualisation or element that is not listed here, use the **idea card** to add your own visualisation or element.
 -  If you want to add details to any visualisation or element, grab an explanation card or add your own explanation.

**Every time you add a visualisation or element, tell us:**
 -  Why did you choose that visualisation or element
 -  How is going to help you during the reflection
 -  Is there any additional information needed?

**Guiding questions about the visualisations:**
 - How can **improve** the bar chart categories? 
 - How can we **improve** the team positioning and communication visualisation
 - What types of **explanations** would you like to have on these visualisations?

*Elements for the tagging tool. Teachers were asked to re-use these elements and add to the canvas elements they would like to have in a tagging and annotation tool.*

## Low-fidelity prototype of TeamVision
**Goal:** Validation of a prototype of a control-view that shows
visualisations and information.
Based on the requirements defined from the prior stage, we designed a low-fidelity prototype with several elements and features to allow teachers to interact and share the information from the visualisations.


*First prototype validated. Here, we added a timeline, video, transcriptions, and navigation and filtering options.*

*Second prototype validated. Here, teachers required simplicity when accessing the data, which led to the creation of these cards with a preview of the information.*

## Interaction design workshops
**Goal:** Define interaction features for accessing and sharing the information with students.
Using paper prototypes, we asked teachers to imagine how they would access, navigate and share the information with students. 


*Teachers were given paper prototypes to discuss how they would imagine the interaction when using the control-view screen.*![Teachers were given paper prototypes to discuss how they would imagine the interaction when using the control-view screen.](https://github.com/vanechev/CHI2025-materials/blob/ea230977b1bf4d9852cd8a25e3bb9933c4f93151/figures/3%20-%20interaction%20design.png)


# Post-hoc interviews with teachers
Teachers were asked about their overall experience, usefulness and ability of the tool to supporting their teaching practice and challenges.     

**Reflecting on the use of *TeamVision***
- How was your experience when using *TeamVision*?
- Did *TeamVision* support your ability to guide the debrief? How?
- Did you encounter challenges when using *TeamVision*? Yes, no? What?

**Usefulness of visualisations (overall)**
- What **visualisation** did you find most useful during the debrief? Why?
- Why did you choose that **visualisation**?
- What **visualisation** did you find challenging to use when preparing your debriefing? Why?

**Usefulness, accuracy and trust (detailed):**
- To what extent do you believe the **visualisation** was *useful* in guiding the reflection on the team’s prioritisation? Why?
- To what extent do you believe the **visualisation** *accurately* represents the team’s prioritisation? Why?
- To what extent do you *trust* the **visualisation** information to judge or reflect on the team’s prioritisation? Why?

# Post-hoc interviews with students 
Questions were asked after students explored their data and visualisations. A set of visualisations from their team was given as a slide deck. They had the opportunity to navigate through these. 

These questions were asked **per visualisation**.
- What is your interpretation of the **visualisation**? 
- Did the **visualisation** support your reflection on your and your team’s performance? How?
- To what extent do you believe this **visualisation** can be *useful* for you to reflect on - your team’s prioritisation? Why?
- To what extent do you believe this **visualisation** *accurately* represents your team's prioritisation? Why?
- To what extent would you *trust* this **visualisation** to judge or reflect on your own performance? Why?
